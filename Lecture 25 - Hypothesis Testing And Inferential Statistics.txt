### Hypothesis Testing & Inferential Statistics

#### Hypothesis Testing

**Definition:**
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions based on sample data. It evaluates whether there is enough evidence to infer that a certain condition holds true for the entire population.

**Steps in Hypothesis Testing:**

1. **State the Hypotheses:**
   - **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no effect or difference, often denoted as "no change" or "no difference."
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha):** Contradicts the null hypothesis and states that there is an effect or difference.

2. **Choose a Significance Level (α):**
   - Typically set at 0.05 or 0.01, representing the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.

3. **Collect Data and Compute a Test Statistic:**
   - Calculate a statistic (e.g., mean, proportion) from the sample data to compare against the null hypothesis.

4. **Determine the P-value:**
   - The P-value is the probability of obtaining results as extreme as observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A lower P-value suggests stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.

5. **Make a Decision:**
   - Compare the P-value to the significance level (α):
     - If P-value ≤ α, reject the null hypothesis.
     - If P-value > α, do not reject the null hypothesis.

**Types of Tests:**
1. **Z-test:** Used for testing the mean of a population when the sample size is large and/or the population standard deviation is known.
2. **T-test:** Used when the sample size is small (typically < 30) or the population standard deviation is unknown.
3. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** Used to compare means of more than two groups.
4. **Chi-square Test:** Used to test the independence of categorical variables.

**Scenario Example:**
A basketball coach claims that his team scores more than 50 points on average per game over a season. Using data from 5 randomly selected games, we can conduct a hypothesis test to validate this claim.

- **Hypotheses:**
  - H₀: μ = 50 (Team scores 50 points on average per game)
  - H₁: μ > 50 (Team scores more than 50 points on average per game)

- **Comparison:**
  - Compare the sample mean (51.2) with the hypothesized mean (50).

- **Decision:**
  - Since the sample mean (51.2) exceeds 50, we might lean towards rejecting the null hypothesis, suggesting that the team indeed scores more than 50 points on average per game.

**Real-Life Use Cases:**
- **A/B Testing (Marketing and Product Development):** Testing different versions of a product or marketing strategy to determine which performs better.
- **Medicine and Healthcare:** Evaluating the effectiveness of a new drug compared to a placebo in clinical trials.

#### Inferential Statistics

**Key Concepts of Inferential Statistics:**

1. **Population and Sample:**
   - **Population:** The entire group about which conclusions are drawn.
   - **Sample:** A subset of the population used to make inferences about the entire group.

2. **Estimation:**
   - **Point Estimation:** Using sample data to estimate an unknown population parameter (e.g., mean, proportion).
   - **Interval Estimation (Confidence Intervals):** Providing a range within which the parameter is expected to lie, with a certain degree of confidence (e.g., 95% or 99%).

**Common Point Estimators:**
- **Sample Mean (¯x):** Estimating the Population Mean (μ).
- **Sample Proportion (p):** Estimating the Population Proportion (p).
- **Sample Variance (s²):** Estimating the Population Variance (σ²).

**Example:**
If we have a sample of students' scores from a class test, the average score calculated from this sample (sample mean) serves as a point estimate of the population mean score, assuming the sample is representative of the entire class.

**Components of Confidence Intervals:**
- **Confidence Level:** Indicates the probability that the confidence interval contains the true population parameter (e.g., 95% or 99%).
- **Margin of Error:** The range above and below the point estimate that the true parameter is expected to fall within.

**Formula for Confidence Interval (Population Mean):**
\[ \text{Confidence Interval} = \bar{x} \pm z \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \]

- Where:
  - \( \bar{x} \) is the sample mean,
  - \( z \) is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level,
  - \( s \) is the sample standard deviation,
  - \( n \) is the sample size.

In conclusion, hypothesis testing and inferential statistics are powerful tools used to draw conclusions about populations based on sample data. They provide a structured approach to making data-driven decisions in various fields, from business and marketing to healthcare and beyond.
