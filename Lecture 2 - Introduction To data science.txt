1. **Understanding the Problem**
    - Define the objectives clearly.
    - Determine how to measure project success.
    - Identify the problem type (e.g., classification, regression).

2. **Gathering Relevant Data**
    - Collect data from various sources.
    - Ensure the data is relevant to the problem.
    - Consider the volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of the data.

3. **Data Preparation & EDA**
    - EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis.
    - Clean the data (handle missing values, remove duplicates).
    - Perform exploratory analysis to understand the data.
    - Prepare the data for error-free analysis.

4. **Feature Engineering & Feature Extraction**
    - Select the most relevant features.
    - Create new features to improve model performance.
    - Reduce dimensionality if the feature space is too large.
    - Select the most important features for modeling.

5. **Model Building & Deployment**
    - Choose appropriate algorithms and train models.
    - Validate model performance using cross-validation.
    - Deploy the model for real-time use or batch processing.
    - Continuously monitor and improve the model as needed.
