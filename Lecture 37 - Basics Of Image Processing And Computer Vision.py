# Your code for loading the Fashion MNIST dataset, preprocessing it, extracting HOG features, training an SVM classifier, and visualizing the results looks quite solid. However, there are a few minor corrections and improvements to be made. Here's the corrected version:

# 1. **Renamed variables for consistency.**
# 2. **Fixed the SVM variable name in the prediction step.**
# 3. **Removed unnecessary comments.**

# Here is the corrected code:

# ```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import fashion_mnist
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cv2
from skimage.feature import hog
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Load the dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = fashion_mnist.load_data()

# Display the shape and data labels
print("Training data shape: ", x_train.shape)
print("Training labels shape: ", y_train.shape)
print("Testing data shape: ", x_test.shape)
print("Testing labels shape: ", y_test.shape)

# Visualizing the dataset
def plot_initial_images(images, labels, class_names):
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 10, figsize=(20, 3))
    for i in range(10):
        ax = axes[i]
        ax.imshow(images[i], cmap='gray')
        ax.set_title(class_names[labels[i]])
        ax.axis('off')
    plt.show()

# Class names
class_names = ['T-shirt/top', 'Trouser/pants', 'Pullover shirt', 'Dress', 'Coat', 'Sandal', 'Shirt', 'Sneaker', 'Bag', 'Ankle boot']

# Plot initial images with labels
plot_initial_images(x_train, y_train, class_names)

# Data preprocessing
x_train = x_train / 255.0
x_test = x_test / 255.0

# Reshape images
x_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)
x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)
print(x_train.shape, x_test.shape)

# Extracting HOG features
def extract_hog_features(images):
    hog_features = []
    for image in images:
        features = hog(image, pixels_per_cell=(4, 4), cells_per_block=(2, 2), visualize=False, channel_axis=-1)
        hog_features.append(features)
    return np.array(hog_features)

# Extract HOG features from train and test data
x_train_hog = extract_hog_features(x_train)
x_test_hog = extract_hog_features(x_test)

# Display shapes of HOG feature arrays
print(x_test_hog.shape)
print(x_train_hog.shape)

# Training classifier
classifier = SVC(kernel='linear', random_state=0)
classifier.fit(x_train_hog, y_train)

# Accuracy
train_accuracy = classifier.score(x_train_hog, y_train)
print(f"Training Accuracy: {train_accuracy}")

# Evaluating model
test_accuracy = classifier.score(x_test_hog, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy}")

# Get predictions on the test set
y_pred = classifier.predict(x_test_hog)

# Function to plot images with true and predicted labels
def plot_output_images(images, true_labels, predicted_labels, class_names):
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 10, figsize=(20, 3))
    for i in range(10):
        ax = axes[i]
        ax.imshow(images[i].reshape(28, 28), cmap='gray')
        ax.set_title(f"True: {class_names[true_labels[i]]}\nPred: {class_names[predicted_labels[i]]}", fontsize=10)
        ax.axis('off')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

# Plot some test images along with their true and predicted labels
# plot_output_images(x_test[:10], y_test[:10], y_pred[:10], class_names)
# ```

# ### Explanation of Changes:

# 1. **Removed commented-out reshape code**: The reshaping logic was fine, and the commented code was redundant.
# 2. **Consistent Naming**: Ensured variable names are consistent, especially for the classifier (used `classifier` instead of `svm` in predictions).
# 3. **Printing Accuracy**: Included labels for accuracy print statements for clarity.

# This corrected version should work without errors and perform the desired operations on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
