### Introduction to Machine Learning

**What is AI?**
AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines. It involves tasks such as learning from experience, reasoning to make decisions, and self-correction based on feedback.

**Terms Used in AI:**
- **Learning:** The ability of a machine to acquire knowledge or skills through experience.
- **Reasoning:** Using logic to make decisions or draw conclusions based on available information.
- **Self-Correction:** The capability of AI systems to improve or correct themselves based on feedback or new data.

**Types of AI:**
1. **Weak AI:** Also known as Narrow AI, it focuses on performing specific tasks within a limited domain.
2. **Strong AI:** Also known as General AI, it aims to replicate human cognitive abilities across a wide range of tasks.

**What is ML?**
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that utilizes statistical methods to enable machines to improve their performance on a task with experience, typically through the use of training data.
- **Human Learning:** Observing, learning skills over time.
- **Machine Learning:** Processing data to build models that make predictions or decisions.

**Types of ML:**
- **Supervised Learning:** Uses labeled data to train models that can make predictions or classifications based on input-output pairs.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Uses unlabeled data to discover patterns or groupings within the data without explicit guidance.

**Types of AI Applications:**
1. **Email Spam Classification:** Supervised Learning (predicting spam or not spam).
2. **Recommendation Systems:** Utilizes both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning techniques.
3. **Cat-Dog Classification:** Supervised Learning (distinguishing between cats and dogs).
4. **Clustering (e.g., Cat-Dog Clustering):** Unsupervised Learning (grouping similar data points without labels).
5. **Playing AlphaGo Game:** Involves both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning aspects for strategic decision-making.

**Historical Evolution:**
- **Artificial Intelligence (1950s-1980s):** Early techniques aimed at enabling computers to mimic human behavior in various tasks.
- **Machine Learning (1980s-2010s):** Focus on algorithms that allow computers to learn from data without explicit programming instructions.
- **Deep Learning (2010s onward):** Subset of ML using neural networks with multiple layers, enabling complex computations and superior performance in tasks like image and speech recognition.

### What is Data Science?
**Data Science** is a multidisciplinary field involving statistical tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights from data. Key aspects include:
- **Data Sources:** Diverse origins such as databases, sensors, business transactions, etc.
- **Insight Extraction:** Using statistical and machine learning methods to derive valuable insights.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building models that forecast outcomes or behavior based on historical data.
  
Data science plays a crucial role in informing decision-making, optimizing processes, and creating predictive models across various domains, contributing to advancements in AI and ML applications.
