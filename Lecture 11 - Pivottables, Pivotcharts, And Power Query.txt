### Pivot Table

A Pivot Table is a powerful tool for summarizing, analyzing, exploring, and presenting data. It allows you to automatically sort, count, and total the values in a dataset, as well as calculate the total of particular values within a set. Pivot Tables display these results in a new table that provides a concise summary of the data.

**Operations:**

4. **Calculating Percentages**: Compute the percentage of totals or percentage changes.

### Pivot Chart

A Pivot Chart is an extension of a Pivot Table that provides a graphical representation of the summarized data. It allows for dynamic data visualization, making it easier to interpret the results.

**Operations:**
1. **Changing Chart Types**: Choose from various chart types such as column, bar, line, etc.
2. **Customizing Chart Elements**: Modify elements like titles, legends, data labels, and colors.
3. **Drilling Down Data**: Interactively explore data points in detail.

### Power Query

Power Query is a tool that allows you to discover, connect, combine, and refine data from various sources. It provides an easy way to import, clean, and transform data before analyzing it in Excel.

**Operations:**
1. **Merging Queries**: Combine data from different tables or sources.
2. **Appending Queries**: Stack data from similar tables.
3. **Unpivoting Columns**: Transform columns into rows for better analysis.
