What is data Science?
Analyzing ana manipulating the data(text, image, audio or video), so that it can predict the further used cases and recommend resonable suggestions accordingly through some recommendation systems.

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. 
It involves techniques from statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to analyze and interpret complex data sets. 
The ultimate goal is to make data-driven decisions and predictions.

Data Science vs AI vs ML:-

Data Science incudes Mathematics & Statistics, Visualization & EDA(analysis) which works as a fundamental building block for both AI and ML.

In AI we provide data to a system in such a way that the system can take their own decisions and provide us the output. Moreover, its like providing a brain to any system 
through which it can take its own decisions. Example - Amazon echo, Google Assistant, etc.

ML or Machine Learning is the subset of AI. It is used to recommend suggestions based on the data that is provided or based on the past instances. Example:- the movie recommendations we get
in various OTT Platforms like Netflix, the recommendation of products we get in various online shopping platforms like Amazon, etc.



NOTE:- AI or Artificial Intellegence is the superset of ML and ML is the superset of DeepLearning. 

AI -->> ML --> DeepLearning
Deeplearning: It contains neurons which is used to solve various Complex Problems.
